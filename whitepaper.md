# Whitepaper: COCO - Bridging Art and Blockchain

## Abstract

COCO is an ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain, intertwining the worlds of art and blockchain technology. This whitepaper delves into the concept, creation, and aspirations of COCO, exploring its origins as a meme-based token and its evolution into a community-driven platform for digital artists.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

COCO is the brainchild of digital artist KeroNFTs, who introduced Coco, the iconic crocodile meme, to the world of Web3. Unlike previous meme tokens, COCO stands out by embracing the artistry of digital content, immutably recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain. The name "Coco" fits within the tradition of four-letter meme tokens like Mumu, Bobo, Dodo, and Pepe. Additionally a cryptocurrency is broadcasted to Ethereum called COCO on ETH, which allows a more diverse set of people to participate in celebrating the COCO meme.

### 1.2 The Value of Memes and Digital Art

The world recognizes that memes have the unique power to bring joy and happiness. Numerous articles highlight the happiness memes bring to our lives. Moreover, the movement of memes in recent times have shown the space has real potential, especially when artists like those found on rarecoco.wtf immortalize them through digital art on the Bitcoin blockchain. Further, since the barrier to entry of purchasing the art itself is high, the ETH based cyrrency allows people to gain financial exposure to the movement using easier and well known methods.

### 1.3 The Birth of Coco Community

COCO's popularity is evident through the wealth of digital art submitted to its dispensary at [rarecoco.wtf](https://rarecoco.wtf) â€” a virtual art gallery on the blockchain. This platform empowers artists, allowing them to profit from their creations when they are purchased using Bitcoin. The value of NFTs may be subject to debate, but the enthusiasm and prolific creation of digital art in the Rare Coco collection are undeniable. The rarecoco collection is now closed to new submissions, but other projects are around which allow the further creation and monetization of COCO based art. 

### 1.4 Community Spirit

COCO fosters a vibrant community united by a shared love for memes and fun. Coco enthusiasts gather in Telegram rooms to connect and identify themselves as proud members of the Coco Community. This sense of belonging is a powerful force in the world of meme tokens. Often people are asking for links to social media sites to engage with and they frequently post their own creations to social media.

## 2. Community-Driven Goals

### 2.1 The Power of Community

Valued community members share a deep affection for memes and the community they have built. They actively promote COCO by regularly engaging the public on social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and beyond. Contributors have also created many "sticker sets", which is a popular method to embrace the meme in regular everyday conversations.

### 2.2 Supporting Artists

The community aspires to play an integral role in supporting digital artists. By acting as ambassadors for COCO, community members will help artists gain recognition and revenue by spreading their art around and pointing interested parties to their points of sale. Through marketing, networking and other means, the team will continue to support coco meme artists, and particularly those associated with the original art site: rarecoco.wtf. It is also possible for the COCO on ETH community to orchestrate giveaways of this art to add value across the ecosystems.

### 2.3 Education

A key objective of the Coco Community is to educate others on collecting digital art and other ways to gain exposure to the Web3 space. This involves providing links to educational videos and articles, as well as instructions on safely purchasing digital art. This includes cross promoting other COCO products, and helping people find out how to get them. Currently there are 5 existing COCO NFT projects: AiCoco, COCO for Ordinals, Snappy Cocos, Coco on ETH, rarecoco.wtf

## 3. The Journey of COCO

### 3.1 Reducing the Initial Supply

To further enhance the utility and value proposition of COCO, the community is actively working on a groundbreaking project. This project revolves around community-curated, AI-generated NFTs which create a burn mechanism with the ultimate goal of reducing the supply of COCO by 20%. This community burn is available on [cocoethtoken.com](http://cocoethtoken.com)

#### 3.1.1 Benefits of Reducing the Supply

Reducing the supply of COCO through this innovative mechanism offers several benefits to the ecosystem:

- **Deflationary Model**: The project introduces a deflationary element, making COCO more resistant to inflationary pressures. This can result in a more stable price dynamics.

- **Community Engagement**: The project fosters community engagement by allowing members to curate and generate NFTs. This involvement strengthens the sense of ownership and commitment within the Coco Community.

- **Artistic Expression**: AI-generated NFTs represent a novel form of artistic expression. This initiative combines technology and creativity, attracting a wider audience to the COCO ecosystem.

- **Long-Term Sustainability**: A decreasing supply can contribute to the long-term sustainability of COCO, ensuring its relevance and value in the evolving blockchain landscape.

## 4. The Future of COCO

### 4.1 A Strong Community

Despite the challenges COCO has faced, the community's resilience and dedication to memes and digital art have kept the token alive. With a vibrant ecosystem and a wealth of creative content, COCO looks poised for a promising future.

### 4.2 A Bridge Between Art and Blockchain

COCO's journey exemplifies the fusion of art and blockchain technology. By supporting artists and nurturing a community, COCO aims to elevate digital art to new heights, bridging the gap between creativity and the blockchain. Thusly, the community plans to help bring COCO meme creators into the spotlight by introducing them to our community in various ways.

### 4.3 Bridging to lower cost L2 chains

In order to provide a fair way to transact should the price of ethereum continue to rise, it is important for the entire ecosystem of ERC20 tokens to become tradeable on EVM compatible L2 chains. Some chains like Arbitrum are aleady compatible and dexes like Uniswap are already allowing liquidity pools on it. It is a future goal to provide methods to onboard regular ethereum users by providing games and incentives which introduce these people to using L2s. This will not only benefit COCO but the entire ethereum ecosystem as well. 

### 4.4 Providing access to other countries and languages

COCO is an international phenomenon, and as such, the team will take measures to provide access to COCO information in other languages. Thus we will make initiatives to translate texts related to the history of COCO, and provide places for people of other languages to chat amongst themselves. Our discord currently provides support for several languages, and our telegram instantly translates chinese and rusian text to english.

## 5. Conclusion

COCO, born as a meme and embraced by a passionate community, represents the potential of meme tokens to transcend mere speculation and contribute to the broader digital art ecosystem. With its commitment to supporting artists, educating others, and pioneering innovative projects like the reduction of the supply, COCO envisions a future where memes and digital art thrive within the Web3 space.
