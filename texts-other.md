## 1. Response to Bitcoin Live author posting incomplete information about bitcoin assets

@OnChainCollege

Hi there! I replied to your post on BCL but thought it was valuable enough information to put here on X

Here's a couple facts about bitcoin "add-ons"

Long before runes and ordinals, NFT's have been on bitcoin since Counterparty was created in 2014. 

Counterparty  is a platform built on the Bitcoin blockchain which enables the  creation and trading of custom digital assets and tokens.

The  Rare Pepe project is an early NFT initiative on the Counterparty  platform that features unique digital trading cards based on the Pepe  the Frog meme, marking one of the first instances of NFTs on the Bitcoin  blockchain. 

The first Rare Pepe, known as the "Satoshi Card,"  was created and registered on the Counterparty platform on September 9,  2016. At its peak market price last year it sold for about 8 bitcoin or  half a million dollars. This also created enough of a buzz to cause the  pepe coin on eth into existence.

Counterparty assets are the  original NFTs on bitcoin and should be represented appropriately, as  they were around before ethereum NFTs. 

Ordinals and runes came  into existence after it was discovered there was money to be made in  this space because of rare pepe. The devs of counterparty are slow, but  working. These new guys are fast to market but also cause the volatility  of which you speak of.

There are still undiscovered  opportunities that are closer to the original pepe. Observe the site  http://pepe.wtf For example, in the "Not Pepes" column see rare cocos. ( see also http://rarecoco.wtf )  This art is less than a year old but many of the pieces came from the  artists who originally made the rare pepes.

This is very  important. Counterparty is the bitcoin of  bitcoin NFTs.
