##  2. A general introduction, (50 seconds)

Introducing COCO, the brainchild of digital artist Kero. Inspired by the success of Pepe NFTs, Kero envisioned a unique meme - a crocodile, the ultimate predator. COCO artists are releasing their art into the wild via rarecocos on xChain. On Ethereum, COCO thrives as the OG, uncopiable currency. The community-driven burn mechanism adds utility, and has reduced the token supply by an additional 5%. 

Kero remains a driving force, releasing an NFT set on ethereum and exploring new projects like Snappy Cocos on Ordinals. The COCO library boasts thousands of images and content, created by many brilliant digital artists. Future plans include contests, bounties and bridging the token to the Arbitrum network to control fees. Join the COCO community, speculate on growth, and snap snap your way into COCO infamy.

## 3. Here is a longer, more intricate introduction which adds much to the narrative behind COCO (2:30)

There is a new meme called COCO. 

Kero, a digital artist in the space known for his pepe NFT's came up with an idea:

After Pepe, Mumu, and Bobo were fanatic memes on ethereum, Kero thought - there must be a meme that fits, where nobody did it before. Then it occurred to Him a crocodile is just the thing - Ahe ultimate predator: he  snaps, he flips and drags you under the water. And so COCO was born.

If you've heard about early pepe, there is an XCP collection from 2014 called rare pepe. Recently a single rare pepe was going for 8 BTC during the PEPE on ETH runup. Many of those OG artists have contributed to the COCO space through NFT's on a bitcoin based network called counter party. 

On the ETH side, a currency was deployed. People who deployed the token have moved on and frens from the community have taken the lead in preserving COCO on ETH as the original currency for the meme.

The community made a burn mechanism, giving the token utility. So far the currencies' supply has been reduced by 5% and more is expected as these AI based tokens mint out.

Members of the community also released other products on other chains, for instance BitcoinJake issued a COCO ordinals project.

COCO on ETH is the original currency and cannot be copied. People who want to speculate on COCO without buying NFTs can feel safe playing their trades with the security and liquidity of the ETH network. In order to control fees, the project plans to bridge the token to the arbitrum network and open liquidity pools there.

Kero, the creator of the meme is still a driving force in pushing out content. Recently he released a set of 200 NFT's on ethereum, as well as his Anappy Cocos on ordinals. He made a project called rare coco, and there are many artists on board who are making memes through rare cocos.

The library of COCO art has become immense. There are thousands of images, sticker sets, and content for all to enjoy. 

COCO will grow slowly and organically, the community will adopt using the memes on social media and speculate on the growth of the meme. The COCO on ETH team is looking for people to help our cause in a better way.

Our current plans include hosting contests, shing a light on the art brought forth by the community, building a bounty program, refining our community initiatives, and having a lot of fun in the memetime. Join us, and become a COCO

Meet COCO, the brainchild of digital artist Kero. Crafted in the spirit of Pepe NFTs, COCO is a one-of-a-kind meme featuring the ultimate predator, the crocodile-pepe. Dive into COCO's rich library of memes, with thousands of captivating images, and get ready for an exciting future ahead. Join the vibrant COCO community and #snapsnap your way into COCO infamy!

The project aims to support the amazing community of artists who have adopted COCO for their own, like PEPE, it strives to establish itself as one of the top meme-based cryptocurrencies. COCO appeals to the cryptocurrency community by instituting a no-tax policy and keeping things pure and simple as a memecoin.

The NFT's created in the COCO community can be challenging to find, and the COCO eth token allows for investors to speculate while showing support for the artist community. The COCO community will always show support for the ecosystem and artists around coco.

The COCO roadmap features three phases, where phase one includes listing on CoinMarketCap, and getting COCO and #snapsnap trending on Twitter, while phase two includes listing on centralized exchanges and phase three includes ‚Äútier 1‚Äù exchange listings.

Who Are the Founders of COCO?

Technically the COCO contract was broadcasted by anonymous developers. But the contract was clean and when they left the community took over. The scale of the COCO meme is not to be underestimated and since this was the original currency, originally blessed by Kero, it will remain the ultimate repository of COCO memes for the entire space, and there are thousands of memes, created by hundreds of artists!

What Makes COCO Unique?

COCO presents a unique offering within the meme coin market by building upon the legacy of Pepe the Frog, a character with a longstanding and controversial history. Like BOBO and MUMU, COCO serves to join the family as the "the ultimate predator who snaps, flips, and drags you under the water"

How Many COCO Coins Are There in Circulation?

The coin's maximum supply is 420,690,000,000,000 and there has been almost 5% burned via personal coin burns and a utility NFT called AiCoco. Of the maximum supply, 100% were sent to the liquidity pool on Uniswap, where LP tokens were burnt, and the smart contract was sent to a null address. A small allocation has been contributed to a community fund called cococommunityfund.eth where budget will be for supporting the COCO artists and helping out the token where possible.

How Is COCO Secured?
COCO is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, which is secured by the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.

## 5. Here is a description we made telling chatGPT to create something in modern slang.

Yo, peep the game on Kero ‚Äì the mastermind behind COCO, vibin' off Pepe NFT

### Messaging about the artists

It‚Äôs important to recognize the artists that are the real power behind COCO. The value of the entire space depends on their continued contributions of making memes. I highly implore you to check out rarecoco.wtf

The learning process of owning a rarecoco is challenging but it is certain that coco art will appreciate over time and there is a definite opportunity to get in here. 

### Regarding Kero and COCO on ETH (as voiced by snowkid)

I'd like to clarify that Kero was around during for the minting of COCO but he did not deploy it, nor have anything to do with the connected wallets that deployed it, or any of the financial decisions related to the currency. In an early conversation, I asked kero about this and he said that some people approached and asked him if they could make a currency. He also mentioned that he really had no say in what happens to the eth token.

### Overheard in the telegram channel

"Who needs sleep when you got a big bag of $COCO"

## 7. COCO NFT projects

 - **Rare Cocos** Like rarepepes before, Rare Cocos are minted on counterparty which is like ordinals but it's been around since 2014. Many artists have contributed to this collection curated by Kero himself. New submissions will be stopped on the 2024 halving and the set will be complete.

## 8. DYOR page

*this is the text used on our [DYOR page](https://cocoethtoken.com/#/token). There are referential links to the facts on the site*

The project is 100% community supported.

When Kero created his coco meme, an anonymous deployer appeared and created COCO on ETH. They have since removed themselves and exited from all of their allocations. Dextools was updated to reflect this change. There is no communication with this entity, nor do they have any continued role in COCO on ETH. After careful chain analysis, it can be concluded that they no longer have any original stake in the token.

Liquidity was provided by the anon deployers, to a Uniswap V2 pool via team.finance the lock period is for 100 years. This renders any price manipulation by removing liquidity impossible for the indeterminate future.

The deployed contract code was verified on etherscan.io using the openZeppelin libraries. It has been checked to ensure the libraries used were not modified. Calling the owner function reveals that ownership of the contract address has been transferred to the zero address.

The original supply of the token was 420.69 trillion. Over 17 trillion (4.04% as of march 2024) has been sent to the burn address. At the time of this writing, 16% of the remaining supply is in the uniswap v2 pool. (28 Mar, 2024)
