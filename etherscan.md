# A record of the application / request process to get etherscan information updated


Letter to etherscan support with ticket ID 495147

0xe6dbeadd1823b0bcfeb27792500b71e510af55b3

The ERC20 contract above, COCO, is a token where the original deployers pushed the contract and then exited all interests, removing social profiles and selling their positions etc. There was a community takeover, and new socials were updated. It has a presence on github as well as the normal telegram and twitter channels. The token is approximately 9 months old. The community is persistent and rolling out initiatives to regain competitive advantage by building products which will attract meme traders to layer 2 products like arbitrum. 

It is of the utmost importance to us that we do not reissue the token in order to overcome obstacles like this.

Your interface does not allow us any means to update, or request an appeal to update the token info on etherscan and the community thereby requests etherscan to allow us to update the token information.

Is there a way this can be manually done?
Here is our info page for our coinmarketcap listing application, it should contain all of the details relevant to updating the token:

Thank you for considering this.
