## NOTICE: THIS IS A PROPOSED WHITEPAPER AND IS NOT COPY SAFE UNTIL RATIFIED BY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY

## Abstract

Coco Coin (COCO) is an ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain, intertwining the worlds of art and blockchain technology. This whitepaper delves into the concept, creation, and aspirations of Coco Coin, exploring its origins as a meme-based token and its evolution into a community-driven platform for digital artists.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Coco Coin is the brainchild of renowned digital artist KeroNFTs, who introduced Coco, the iconic crocodile meme, to the world of Web3. Unlike previous meme tokens, Coco Coin stands out by embracing the artistry of digital content, immutably recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain. The name "Coco" fits within the tradition of four-letter meme tokens like Mumu, Bobo, Dodo, and Pepe.

### 1.2 The Value of Memes and Digital Art

The world recognizes that memes have the unique power to bring joy and happiness. Numerous articles highlight the happiness memes bring to our lives. Moreover, memes have proven their profitability and investment potential, especially when artists like KeroNFTs immortalize them through digital art on the Bitcoin blockchain.

### 1.3 The Birth of Coco Community

Coco Coin's popularity is evident through the wealth of digital art submitted to its dispensary at [rarecoco.wtf](https://rarecoco.wtf) â€” a virtual art gallery on the blockchain. This platform empowers artists, allowing them to profit from their creations when they are purchased using Bitcoin. The value of NFTs may be subject to debate, but the enthusiasm and prolific creation of digital art in the Rare Coco collection are undeniable.

### 1.4 Community Spirit

Coco Coin is more than just a financial investment; it fosters a vibrant community united by a shared love for memes and fun. Coco enthusiasts gather in Telegram rooms to connect and identify themselves as proud members of the Coco Community. This sense of belonging is a powerful force in the world of meme tokens.

## 2. Community-Driven Goals

### 2.1 The Power of Community

Coco Coin investors are not solely motivated by profit; they share a deep affection for memes and the community they have built. The Coco Community actively promotes Coco Coin by engaging the public on social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and beyond.

### 2.2 Supporting Artists

Coco Coin's vision extends beyond mere profit generation. The community aspires to play an integral role in supporting digital artists. By acting as ambassadors for Coco Coin, community members help artists gain recognition and revenue.

### 2.3 Educating Investors

A key objective of the Coco Community is to educate investors on the value of investing in digital art within the Web3 space. This involves providing links to educational videos and articles, as well as instructions on safely purchasing digital art. The community seeks to expand the digital art community and increase the value of the art produced.

## 3. The Journey of Coco Coin

### 3.1 Reducing the Initial Supply

To further enhance the utility and value proposition of Coco Coin, the community is actively working on a groundbreaking project. This project revolves around community-curated, AI-generated NFTs that will create a burn mechanism with the ultimate goal of reducing the supply of Coco Coin by 20%.

#### 3.1.1 Benefits of Reducing the Supply

Reducing the supply of Coco Coin through this innovative mechanism offers several benefits to the ecosystem:

- **Scarcity and Value**: As the supply decreases, Coco Coin becomes scarcer, potentially driving up its value. Investors and collectors are more likely to hold and invest in a token with a decreasing supply.

- **Deflationary Model**: The project introduces a deflationary element, making Coco Coin more resistant to inflationary pressures. This can result in a more stable and attractive investment.

- **Community Engagement**: The project fosters community engagement by allowing members to curate and generate NFTs. This involvement strengthens the sense of ownership and commitment within the Coco Community.

- **Artistic Expression**: AI-generated NFTs represent a novel form of artistic expression. This initiative combines technology and creativity, attracting a wider audience to the Coco Coin ecosystem.

- **Long-Term Sustainability**: A decreasing supply can contribute to the long-term sustainability of Coco Coin, ensuring its relevance and value in the evolving blockchain landscape.

## 4. The Future of Coco Coin

### 4.1 A Strong Community

Despite the challenges Coco Coin has faced, the community's resilience and dedication to memes and digital art have kept the token alive. With a vibrant ecosystem and a wealth of creative content, Coco Coin looks poised for a promising future.

### 4.2 A Bridge Between Art and Blockchain

Coco Coin's journey exemplifies the fusion of art and blockchain technology. By supporting artists and nurturing a community, Coco Coin aims to elevate digital art to new heights, bridging the gap between creativity and the blockchain.

## 5. Conclusion

Coco Coin, born as a meme and embraced by a passionate community, represents the potential of meme tokens to transcend mere speculation and contribute to the broader digital art ecosystem. With its commitment to supporting artists, educating investors, and pioneering innovative projects like the reduction of the supply, Coco Coin envisions a future where memes and digital art thrive within the Web3 space.
