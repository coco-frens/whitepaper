# - [New Listing] Add cryptoasset
COCO ETH TOKEN - COCO - Add cryptoasset/exchange

# Relationship with the Project
I am a (doxxed) founder of the "community takeover" for this crypto asset. During the first couple months of the token's existence, the anonymous devs were present, but at some point they deleted the social channels and sold their token allocations to the uniswap pool. At that point Myself and a few other invested partied decided to build a community around the token anyway. I manage the community fund, which holds, and will occasionally buy and sell COCO into its treasury. Funds were seeded by community donations.

# Detailed Project Description (Cryptoasset)
About COCO

Meet COCO, the brainchild of digital artist Kero. Crafted in the spirit of Pepe NFTs, COCO is a one-of-a-kind meme featuring the ultimate predator, the crocodile-pepe. Dive into COCO's rich library of memes, with thousands of captivating images, and get ready for an exciting future ahead. Join the vibrant COCO community and #snapsnap your way into COCO infamy!

The project aims to support the amazing community of artists who have adopted COCO for their own, like PEPE, it strives to establish itself as one of the top meme-based cryptocurrencies. COCO appeals to the cryptocurrency community by instituting a no-tax policy and keeping things pure and simple as a memecoin.

The NFT's created in the COCO community can be challenging to find, and the COCO eth token allows for investors to speculate while showing support for the artist community. The COCO community will always show support for the ecosystem and artists around coco.

The COCO roadmap features three phases, where phase one includes listing on CoinMarketCap, and getting COCO and #snapsnap trending on Twitter, while phase two includes listing on centralized exchanges and phase three includes “tier 1” exchange listings.

Who Are the Founders of COCO?

Technically the COCO contract was broadcasted by anonymous developers. But the contract was clean and when they left the community took over. The scale of the COCO meme is not to be underestimated and since this was the original currency, originally blessed by Kero, it will remain the ultimate repository of COCO memes for the entire space, and there are thousands of memes, created by hundreds of artists!

What Makes COCO Unique?

COCO presents a unique offering within the meme coin market by building upon the legacy of Pepe the Frog, a character with a longstanding and controversial history. Like BOBO and MUMU, COCO serves to join the family as the "the ultimate predator who snaps, flips, and drags you under the water"

How Many COCO Coins Are There in Circulation?

The coin's maximum supply is 420,690,000,000,000 and there has been almost 5% burned via personal coin burns and a utility NFT called AiCoco. Of the maximum supply, 100% were sent to the liquidity pool on Uniswap, where LP tokens were burnt, and the smart contract was sent to a null address. A small allocation has been contributed to a community fund called cococommunityfund.eth where budget will be for supporting the COCO artists and helping out the token where possible.

How Is COCO Secured?
COCO is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, which is secured by the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.
